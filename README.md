# Semantic Memory

**Semantic Memory** (SM) is an open-source [service](dotnet/Service/README.md) and
[plugin](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-365/blog/2023/05/23/empowering-every-developer-with-plugins-for-microsoft-365-copilot/)
specialized in the efficient indexing of datasets through custom continuous data
hybrid pipelines. For some scenarios SM is also available as a library, and soon
as a Docker container.

Utilizing advanced embeddings and LLMs, the system enables Natural Language
querying for obtaining answers from the indexed data, complete with citations
and links to the original sources.

# Semantic Memory in serverless mode

Semantic Memory works and scales at best when running as a service, allowing to
ingest thousands of documents and information without blocking your app.

However, you can use Semantic Memory also serverless, embedding the `MemoryServerlessClient`
in your app.

> ### Importing documents into your Semantic Memory can be as simple as this:
>
> ```csharp
> var memory = new MemoryClientBuilder()
>     .WithOpenAIDefaults(Env.Var("OPENAI_API_KEY"))
>     .Build();
>
> // Import a file
> await memory.ImportDocumentAsync("meeting-transcript.docx", tags: new() { { "user", "Blake" } });
>
> // Import multiple files and apply multiple tags
> await memory.ImportDocumentAsync(new Document("file001")
>     .AddFile("business-plan.docx")
>     .AddFile("project-timeline.pdf")
>     .AddTag("user", "Blake")
>     .AddTag("collection", "business")
>     .AddTag("collection", "plans")
>     .AddTag("fiscalYear", "2023"));
> ```

> ### Asking questions:
>
> ```csharp
> var answer1 = await memory.AskAsync("How many people attended the meeting?");
>
> var answer2 = await memory.AskAsync("what's the project timeline?", filter: new MemoryFilter().ByTag("user", "Blake"));
> ```

The code leverages the default documents ingestion pipeline:

1. Extract text: recognize the file format and extract the information
2. Partition the text in small chunks, to optimize search
3. Extract embedding using an LLM embedding generator
4. Save embedding into a vector index such as
   [Azure Cognitive Search](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/search/vector-search-overview),
   [Qdrant](https://qdrant.tech/) or other DBs.

Documents are organized by users, safeguarding their private information.
Furthermore, memories can be categorized and structured using **tags**, enabling
efficient search and retrieval through faceted navigation.

# Data lineage, citations

All memories and answers are fully correlated to the data provided. When
producing an answer, Semantic Memory includes all the information needed
to verify its accuracy:

```csharp
await memory.ImportFileAsync("NASA-news.pdf");

var answer = await memory.AskAsync("Any news from NASA about Orion?");

Console.WriteLine(answer.Result + "/n");

foreach (var x in answer.RelevantSources)
{
    Console.WriteLine($"  * {x.SourceName} -- {x.Partitions.First().LastUpdate:D}");
}
```

> Yes, there is news from NASA about the Orion spacecraft. NASA has invited the
> media to see a new test version of the Orion spacecraft and the hardware that
> will be used to recover the capsule and astronauts upon their return from
> space during the Artemis II mission. The event is scheduled to take place at

## Using Semantic Memory Service

Depending on your scenarios, you might want to run all the code **locally
inside your process, or remotely through an asynchronous service.**

If you're importing small files, and need only C# or only Python, and can block
the process during the import, local-in-process execution can be fine, using
the **MemoryServerlessClient** seen above.

However, if you are in one of these scenarios:

* I'd just like a web service to import data and send queries to answer
* My app is written in **TypeScript, Java, Rust, or some other language**
* I want to define **custom pipelines mixing multiple languages**
  like Python, TypeScript, etc
* I'm importing **big documents that can require minutes to process**, and
  I don't want to block the user interface
* I need memory import to **run independently, supporting failures and retry
  logic**

then you can deploy Semantic Memory as a service, plugging in the
default handlers or your custom Python/TypeScript/Java/etc. handlers,
and leveraging the asynchronous non-blocking memory encoding process,
sending documents and asking questions using the **MemoryWebClient**.

[Here](dotnet/Service/README.md) you can find a complete set of instruction
about [how to run the Semantic Memory service](dotnet/Service/README.md).

If you want to give the service a quick test, use the following command
to **start the Semantic Memory Service**:

> ### On WSL / Linux / MacOS:
>
> ```shell
> cd dotnet/Service
> ./setup.sh
> ./run.sh
> ```

> ### On Windows:
>
> ```shell
> cd dotnet\Service
> setup.cmd
> run.cmd
> ```

> ### To import files using Semantic Memory **web service**, use `MemoryWebClient`:
>
> ```csharp
> #reference dotnet/ClientLib/ClientLib.csproj
>
> var memory = new MemoryWebClient("http://127.0.0.1:9001"); // <== URL where the web service is running
>
> // Import a file (default user)
> await memory.ImportDocumentAsync("meeting-transcript.docx");
>
> // Import a file specifying a Document ID, User and Tags
> await memory.ImportDocumentAsync("business-plan.docx",
>     new DocumentDetails("user@some.email", "file001")
>         .AddTag("collection", "business")
>         .AddTag("collection", "plans")
>         .AddTag("fiscalYear", "2023"));
> ```

> ### Getting answers via the web service
> ```
> curl http://127.0.0.1:9001/ask -d'{"query":"Any news from NASA about Orion?"}' -H 'Content-Type: application/json'
> ```
> ```json
> {
>   "Query": "Any news from NASA about Orion?",
>   "Text": "Yes, there is news from NASA about the Orion spacecraft. NASA has invited the media to see a new test version of the Orion spacecraft and the hardware that will be used to recover the capsule and astronauts upon their return from space during the Artemis II mission.

## Custom memory ingestion pipelines

On the other hand, if you need a custom data pipeline, you can also
customize the steps, which will be handled by your custom business logic:

```csharp
// Memory setup, e.g. how to calculate and where to store embeddings
var memoryBuilder = new MemoryClientBuilder().WithOpenAIDefaults(Env.Var("OPENAI_API_KEY"));
memoryBuilder.Build();
var orchestrator = memoryBuilder.GetOrchestrator();

// Define custom .NET handlers
var step1 = new MyHandler1("step1", orchestrator);
var step2 = new MyHandler2("step2", orchestrator);
var step3 = new MyHandler3("step3", orchestrator);
await orchestrator.AddHandlerAsync(step1);
await orchestrator.AddHandlerAsync(step2);
await orchestrator.AddHandlerAsync(step3);

// Instantiate a custom pipeline
var pipeline = orchestrator
    .PrepareNewFileUploadPipeline("user-id-1", "mytest", new[] { "memory-collection" })
    .AddUploadFile("file1", "file1.docx", "file1.docx")
    .AddUploadFile("file2", "file2.pdf", "file2.pdf")
    .Then("step1")
    .Then("step2")
    .Then("step3")
    .Build();

// Execute in process, process all files with all the handlers
await orchestrator.RunPipelineAsync(pipeline);
```
