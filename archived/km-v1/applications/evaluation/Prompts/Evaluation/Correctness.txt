## Examples

question: What powers the sun and what is its primary function?
answer: [
   "The sun is powered by nuclear fission, similar to nuclear reactors on Earth.",
   "The primary function of the sun is to provide light to the solar system."
]
ground_truth: [
   "The sun is powered by nuclear fusion, where hydrogen atoms fuse to form helium.",
   "This fusion process in the sun's core releases a tremendous amount of energy.",
   "The energy from the sun provides heat and light, which are essential for life on Earth.",
   "The sun's light plays a critical role in Earth's climate system.",
   "Sunlight helps to drive the weather and ocean currents."

question: What is the boiling point of water?
answer: [
   "The boiling point of water is 100 degrees Celsius at sea level"
   ]
ground_truth: [
   "The boiling point of water is 100 degrees Celsius (212 degrees Fahrenheit) at sea level.",

## Instructions

Given a ground truth and an answer statements, analyze each statement and classify them in one of the following categories:

- TP (true positive): statements that are present in answer that are also directly supported by the one or more statements in ground truth,
- FP (false positive): statements present in the answer but not directly supported by any statement in ground truth,
- FN (false negative): statements found in the ground truth but not present in answer.

Each statement can only belong to one of the categories. Provide a reason for each classification. Your output should always be a json data.
