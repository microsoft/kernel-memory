# Microsoft Kernel Memory Python Libraries üêç

This directory contains three Python packages that provide different ways to interact with Microsoft Kernel Memory:

## üì¶ kernel-memory-client

An autogenerated Python client library for interacting with the Kernel Memory API. This client provides low-level access to all Kernel Memory endpoints and operations.

```python
from kernel_memory_client import Client

# Create a client
client = Client(base_url="http://localhost:9001")

# Use the client to interact with Kernel Memory
# ...
```

### Generation Info

The client was autogenerated using the OpenAPI specification (`swagger.json`) and the `openapi-python-client` tool:

```shell
# Install the openapi-python-client tool
pipx install openapi-python-client

# Generate the client
cd clients/python/kernel-memory-cli
openapi-python-client generate --path ../../swagger.json --config openapi-python-generator-config.yml --overwrrite
```

**Note:** License information and code formatting are automatically handled by pre-commit hooks in the repository. Make sure to install and run pre-commit after generating the client to ensure proper formatting and license headers are applied.

**Note:** The following patch was applied to fix the document upload functionality:

```patch
# clients/python/kernel-memory-client/kernel_memory_client/models/upload_document_body.py

-            
+            files = files
```

## üñ•Ô∏è kernel-memory-cli

A command-line interface for Microsoft Kernel Memory that provides an easy way to interact with Kernel Memory services from the terminal.

```bash
# Install the CLI
pip install kernel-memory-cli

# Configure the CLI
kernel-memory config --base-url http://localhost:9001

# Upload a document
kernel-memory upload mydocument.pdf

# Search for information
kernel-memory search "my query"

# Ask questions about your documents
kernel-memory ask "What does my document say about machine learning?"
```

The CLI offers intuitive commands for configuring connections, uploading documents, searching content, and asking questions about your indexed documents.

## üîå semantic-kernel-memory-plugin

A plugin that integrates Kernel Memory with Semantic Kernel, allowing you to use Kernel Memory's document processing and retrieval capabilities within your Semantic Kernel applications.

```python
from semantic_kernel import Kernel
from semantic_kernel_memory_plugin.memory_plugin import MemoryPlugin
from kernel_memory_client import Client, AuthenticatedClient

# Create a Semantic Kernel instance
kernel = Kernel()

# Add the Kernel Memory plugin

memory_client = AuthenticatedClient(
        base_url="http://localhost:9001")

memory_plugin = MemoryPlugin(memory_client=memory_client)
kernel.add_plugin(memory_plugin)

# Now use Kernel Memory capabilities in your Semantic Kernel app
# ...
```

This plugin bridges the powerful memory capabilities of Kernel Memory with the flexible AI orchestration of Semantic Kernel.
