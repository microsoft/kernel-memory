[![Discord](https://img.shields.io/discord/1063152441819942922?label=Discord&logo=discord&logoColor=white&color=d82679)](https://aka.ms/KMdiscord)

**Kernel Memory** (KM) is a **multi-modal [AI Service](https://github.com/microsoft/kernel-memory/service/Service/README.md)**
specialized in the efficient indexing of datasets through custom continuous data
hybrid pipelines, with support for
**[Retrieval Augmented Generation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prompt_engineering#Retrieval-augmented_generation)** (
RAG),
synthetic memory, prompt engineering, and custom semantic memory processing.

KM is available as a **Web Service**,
as a **[Docker container](https://hub.docker.com/r/kernelmemory/service)**,
a **[Plugin](https://learn.microsoft.com/copilot/plugins/overview)**
for ChatGPT/Copilot/Semantic Kernel, and as a .NET library for embedded applications.

Utilizing advanced embeddings and LLMs, the system enables Natural Language
querying for obtaining answers from the indexed data, complete with citations
and links to the original sources.

Designed for seamless integration as a Plugin with
[Semantic Kernel](https://github.com/microsoft/semantic-kernel), Microsoft
Copilot and ChatGPT, Kernel Memory enhances data-driven features in applications
built for most popular AI platforms.

# Synchronous Memory API (aka "serverless")

Kernel Memory works and scales at best when running as an asynchronous **Web Service**, allowing to
ingest thousands of documents and information without blocking your app.

However, Kernel Memory can also run in serverless mode, embedding `MemoryServerless`
class instance in .NET backend/console/desktop apps in synchronous mode. This approach
works as well as in ASP.NET Web APIs and Azure Functions. Each request is processed
immediately, although calling clients are responsible for handling transient errors.

# Memory as a Service - Asynchronous API

Depending on your scenarios, you might want to run all the code **locally
inside your process, or remotely through an asynchronous and scalable service.**

![image](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/microsoft/kernel-memory/main/docs/infra-async.png)

If you're importing small files, and need only C# and can block
the process during the import, local-in-process execution can be fine, using
the **MemoryServerless** seen above.

However, if you are in one of these scenarios:

- I'd just like a web service to import data and send queries to answer
- My app is written in **TypeScript, Java, Rust, or some other language**
- I'm importing **big documents that can require minutes to process**, and
  I don't want to block the user interface
- I need memory import to **run independently, supporting failures and retry
  logic**
- I want to define **custom pipelines mixing multiple languages**
  like Python, TypeScript, etc

then you can deploy Kernel Memory as a backend service, plugging in the
default handlers, or your custom Python/TypeScript/Java/etc. handlers,
and leveraging the asynchronous non-blocking memory encoding process,
sending documents and asking questions using the **MemoryWebClient**.

[Here](https://github.com/microsoft/kernel-memory/tree/main/service/Service/README.md) you can find a complete set of instruction
about [how to run the Kernel Memory service](https://github.com/microsoft/kernel-memory/tree/main/service/Service/README.md).

# Kernel Memory (KM) and SK Semantic Memory (SM)

**Kernel Memory (KM) is a service** built on the feedback received and lessons learned
from developing Semantic Kernel (SK) and Semantic Memory (SM). It provides several
features that would otherwise have to be developed manually, such as storing files,
extracting text from files, providing a framework to secure users' data, etc.
The KM codebase is entirely in .NET, which eliminates the need to write and maintain
features in multiple languages. As a service, **KM can be used from any language, tool,
or platform, e.g. browser extensions and ChatGPT assistants.**

**Semantic Memory (SM) is a library for C#, Python, and Java** that wraps direct calls
to databases and supports vector search. It was developed as part of the Semantic
Kernel (SK) project and serves as the first public iteration of long-term memory.
The core library is maintained in three languages, while the list of supported
storage engines (known as "connectors") varies across languages.

Here's comparison table:
