**Kernel Memory** (KM) is a **multi-modal [AI Service](service/Service/README.md)**
specialized in the efficient indexing of documents and information through custom continuous data
pipelines, with support for
**[Retrieval Augmented Generation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prompt_engineering#Retrieval-augmented_generation)** (RAG),
synthetic memory, prompt engineering, and custom semantic memory processing.

KM supports PDF and Word documents, PowerPoint presentations, Images, Spreadsheets [and more](extensions/data-formats),
extracting information and generating memories by leveraging Large Language Models (LLMs), Embeddings and Vector
storage.

Utilizing advanced embeddings, LLMs and prompt engineering, the system enables Natural Language
**querying for obtaining answers** from the information stored, complete with citations
and links to the original sources.

Kernel Memory is designed for seamless integration with any programming language, providing a
**web service** that can also be consumed as an [OpenAPI endpoint for ChatGPT](https://openai.com/blog/chatgpt-plugins),
web clients ready to use, and a Plugin
for [Microsoft Copilot](https://www.microsoft.com/microsoft-365/blog/2023/05/23/empowering-every-developer-with-plugins-for-microsoft-365-copilot)
and [Semantic Kernel](https://github.com/microsoft/semantic-kernel).

## Kernel Memory (KM) and Semantic Memory (SM)

**Kernel Memory (KM) is a service** built on the feedback received and lessons learned
from developing Semantic Kernel (SK) and Semantic Memory (SM). It provides several
features that would otherwise have to be developed manually, such as storing files,
extracting text from files, providing a framework to secure users' data, etc.
The KM codebase is entirely in .NET, which eliminates the need to write and maintain
features in multiple languages. As a service, **KM can be used from any language, tool,
or platform, e.g. browser extensions and ChatGPT assistants.**

**Semantic Memory (SM) is a library for C#, Python, and Java** that wraps direct calls
to databases and supports vector search. It was developed as part of the Semantic
Kernel (SK) project and serves as the first public iteration of long-term memory.
The core library is maintained in three languages, while the list of supported
storage engines (known as "connectors") varies across languages.
