## Upload a document

The following script uploads a markdown file, showing the successful response returned
by the web service.

```python
import requests

files = {
    "file1": ("README.md", open("README.md", "rb")),
}

data = {
    "documentId": "doc01",
}

response = requests.post("http://127.0.0.1:9001/upload", files=files, data=data)

print(response.text)
```

## Query

The following sends a question to the web service, printing the resulting answer
generated by Kernel Memory.

```python
import requests
import json

data = {"question": "Name one tool that I can use from command line"}

response = requests.post(
    "http://127.0.0.1:9001/ask",
    headers={"Content-Type": "application/json"},
    data=json.dumps(data),
).json()

if "text" in response:
    print(response["text"])
else:
    print("Response does not contain a 'text' property.")
```

If you run the scripts, the output will look similar to:

{: .console }
> _You can use the "upload-file.sh", "ask.sh", and "search.sh" tools from the command line._
