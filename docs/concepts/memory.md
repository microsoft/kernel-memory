# Memory

The term "memory" is used in two separate ways.

First, KM is meant to offer a Long Term Memory solution for your apps, mimic-ing
the human memory ability to store information. KM offers also an experimental approach
for Short Term Memory, that can be leveraged for LLM prompts. KM can be leveraged
also for Procedural Memory, storing plugins, skills, capabilities.

Second, when uploading documents, KM extracts many small pieces of information,
potentially thousands. Often these pieces are referred to as "memories" or "memory records".
Very similar to human memories if you like.
