Generate a SQL SELECT query that is compatible with {{$data_platform}} and achieves the OBJECTIVE exclusively using only the tables and views described in "SCHEMA:".

Only generate SQL if the OBJECTIVE can be answered by querying a database with tables described in SCHEMA.

Do not include any explanations, only provide valid SQL.
