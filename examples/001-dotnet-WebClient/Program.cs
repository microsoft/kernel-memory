        Question: What's E = m*c^2?

        Answer: E = m*c^2 is the formula representing the principle of mass-energy equivalence, which was introduced by Albert Einstein. In this equation,
        E stands for energy, m represents mass, and c is the speed of light in a vacuum, which is approximately 299,792,458 meters per second (m/s).
        The equation states that the energy (E) of a system in its rest frame is equal to its mass (m) multiplied by the square of the speed of light (c^2).
        This implies that mass and energy are interchangeable; a small amount of mass can be converted into a large amount of energy and vice versa,
        due to the speed of light being a very large number when squared. This concept is a fundamental principle in physics and has important implications
        in various fields, including nuclear physics and cosmology.

        Question: What's Kernel Memory?

        Answer: Kernel Memory (KM) is a multi-modal AI Service designed to efficiently index datasets through custom continuous data hybrid pipelines. It
        supports various advanced features such as Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG), synthetic memory, prompt engineering, and custom semantic memory
        processing. KM is equipped with a GPT Plugin, web clients, a .NET library for embedded applications, and is available as a Docker container.

        The service utilizes advanced embeddings and Large Language Models (LLMs) to enable natural language querying, allowing users to obtain answers from
        indexed data, complete with citations and links to the original sources. KM is designed for seamless integration with other tools and services, such
        as Semantic Kernel, Microsoft Copilot, and ChatGPT, enhancing data-driven features in applications built for popular AI platforms.

        KM is built upon the feedback and lessons learned from the development of Semantic Kernel (SK) and Semantic Memory (SM). It provides several features
        that would otherwise require manual development, such as file storage, text extraction from files, a framework to secure user data, and more. The KM
        codebase is entirely in .NET, which simplifies maintenance and eliminates the need for multi-language support. As a service, KM can be utilized from
        any language, tool, or platform, including browser extensions and ChatGPT assistants.

        Kernel Memory supports a wide range of data formats, including web pages, PDFs, images, Word, PowerPoint, Excel, Markdown, text, JSON, and more.
        It offers various search capabilities, such

        Taylor Answer: Yes, there is news from NASA regarding the Orion spacecraft. NASA has invited media to view the new test version of the Orion spacecraft
            and the hardware that will be used to recover the capsule and astronauts upon their return from space during the Artemis II mission. The event is
            scheduled to take place at 11 a.m. PDT on Wednesday, August 2, at Naval Base San Diego.

            NASA, along with the U.S. Navy and the U.S. Air Force, is currently conducting the first in a series of tests in the Pacific Ocean to demonstrate and
            evaluate the processes, procedures, and hardware for recovery operations for crewed Artemis missions. These tests are crucial for preparing the team
            for Artemis II, which will be NASA’s first crewed mission under the Artemis program. Artemis II aims to send four astronauts in the Orion spacecraft
            around the Moon to check out systems ahead of future lunar missions.

            The crew for Artemis II includes NASA astronauts Reid Wiseman, Victor Glover, and Christina Koch, as well as CSA (Canadian Space Agency) astronaut
            Jeremy Hansen. They will participate in recovery testing at sea next year.

            For more information about the Artemis program, NASA has provided a link: https://www.nasa.gov/artemis.

        Azure Active Directory (AAD) authentication mechanism. To test this locally, you can set the environment variables AZURE_TENANT_ID, AZURE_CLIENT_ID, and
        AZURE_CLIENT_SECRET. If you choose to use an "APIKey", you would need to provide the actual API key in the configuration.
