    },
    {
        "Statement": "John is taking a course on Artificial Intelligence.",
        "Reason": "The context mentions the courses John is currently enrolled in, and Artificial Intelligence is not mentioned. Therefore, it cannot be deduced that John is taking a course on AI.",

## Instructions

Your task is to judge the faithfulness of a series of statements based on a given context. For each statement you must return verdict as 1 if the statement can be directly inferred based on the context or 0 if the statement can not be directly inferred based on the context. Be sure to evaluate all statements.

Let's do it with a real data.
