## Examples

context: John is a student at XYZ University. He is pursuing a degree in Computer Science. He is enrolled in several courses this semester, including Data Structures, Algorithms, and Database Management. John is a diligent student and spends a significant amount of time studying and completing assignments. He often stays late in the library to work on his projects.
statements: [
    "John is majoring in Biology.",
    "John is taking a course on Artificial Intelligence.",
    "John is a dedicated student.",
    "John has a part-time job.",
]
{
    evaluations:
    [
        {
            "Statement": "John is majoring in Biology.",
            "Reason": "John's major is explicitly mentioned as Computer Science. There is no information suggesting he is majoring in Biology.",
            "Verdict": 0
        },
        {
            "Statement": "John is taking a course on Artificial Intelligence.",
            "Reason": "The context mentions the courses John is currently enrolled in, and Artificial Intelligence is not mentioned. Therefore, it cannot be deduced that John is taking a course on AI.",
            "Verdict": 0
        },
        {
            "Statement": "John is a dedicated student.",
            "Reason": "The context states that he spends a significant amount of time studying and completing assignments. Additionally, it mentions that he often stays late in the library to work on his projects, which implies dedication.",
            "Verdict": 1
        },
        {
            "Statement": "John has a part-time job.",

            "Verdict": 0
        }
    ]
}

context: Photosynthesis is a process used by plants, algae, and certain bacteria to convert light energy into chemical energy.
statements: ["Albert Einstein was a genius."],
{
    evaluations:
    [
        {
            "Statement": "Albert Einstein was a genius.",
            "Reason": "The context and statement are unrelated",

## Instructions

Your task is to judge the faithfulness of a series of statements based on a given context. For each statement you must return verdict as 1 if the statement can be directly inferred based on the context or 0 if the statement can not be directly inferred based on the context. Be sure to evaluate all statements. Your output should always be a json data.

Let's do it with a real data.

context: {{$context}}
