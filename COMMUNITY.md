# Welcome to the Semantic Kernel / Kernel Memory Community!

Below are some ways that you can get involved.

## Engage on Github

File issues, submit PRs, and provide feedback and ideas to what you'd like to
see from the Kernel Memory. We do our best to respond to each submission.

## Public Semantic Kernel Community Office Hours

We regularly have Community Office Hours that are open to the **public** to join.

Add Semantic Kernel events to your calendar: download the

If you are unable to make it live, all meetings will be recorded and posted online.

We have a growing and active channel on Discord where you can get help, engage
